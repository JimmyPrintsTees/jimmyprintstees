How Digital Heat Transfer Printing Works (Step-by-Step)
Digital heat transfer printing works by printing your custom design onto a heat transfer paper, then heat pressing the t shirt design onto a t-shirt.
You can print your design onto the heat transfer paper using most if not any inkjet printer.
To do digital transfer printing, here are the steps:
1.	Print your design onto a heat transfer paper using an inkjet printer
2.	Cut out your design from the heat transfer paper
3.	Place your shirt onto the heat press and align your design onto the shirt
4.	Place a Teflon sheet over the design and heat press the shirt for 20 seconds
5.	Lift the handle to open the heat press. Remove the Teflon sheet and peel off the paper.
6.	Heat press the shirt again for 20 seconds to ensure the print stays.
7.	Lift up the handle to open the heat press. And with that, you’re done!
